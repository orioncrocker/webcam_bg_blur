Provide an extra layer of privacy to your webcam feed

## Covid-19 related privacy concerns
If you've attended a Zoom, Discord video chat, or Google Hangouts meeting during the 2020 Pandemic, chances are you have gotten a peek into someone else's home. webcam_bg_blur is my response to this benign invasion of privacy, as well as a good excuse to learn a bit about OpenCV.

While there are other solutions to this problem (such as Zoom's background replacement tool), I've found that they are distracting and look unprofessional. Instead of overlaying another image on the background, webcam_bg_blur will blur any part of the image not in the foreground, adding an extra layer of privacy to your webcam feed while still looking professional in your own home.
